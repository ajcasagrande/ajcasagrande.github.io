## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anthony Casagrande and I am a Staff Software Engineer currently looking for opportunities to further the fields of AI/ML and Computer Vision in the Open Source ecosystem.

# âœ¨ Open Source Projects

## Recipient of the 2022 EdgeX Foundry Innovation Award!
In 2022, I received the prestigious EdgeX Foundry Innovation Award, recognizing my significant contributions to one of the largest open-source edge computing projects. My work included developing innovative device and application services, addressing critical bugs, and proposing numerous feature improvements based on real world usage, demonstrating a strong commitment to the EdgeX community and advancing the platform's capabilities for real-world use cases.
